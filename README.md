# TAzipfileapp1

The purpose of the TA zip file app is that it allows the user to extract, unzip, and basically analyze any zip files.
Mainly created for TA’s at Stony Brook University, anybody can use it organize the contents of a zip file. To begin 
the user will have to copy and paste all of the zip files into the folder BlackboardSub. After that, the program will 
be ready to be used. When the application starts it will ask the user to name the current project that they are working.
The user will then enter the first screen of the application, where the contents of the BlackboardSub folder will be 
displayed. When the user clicks extract, only zip files will be extracted from the folder and anything else will be discarded.
In the next step, the application renames the folder and makes the name of the zip file into something that is much more 
manageable. For example at Stony Brook University, the zip files that are downloaded are often given very long names. In this 
step it shortens it and makes it easier for the TA’s to look at it. On the unzip screen, it allows the user to “unzip” the
file, which creates a directory for each student in the projects directory of the project.After that is the most important 
part of the project, the Extract Source code screen. In this screen, it allows the user to extract and take out the contents
of the individual zip files. Finally, throughout the application, the user has the ability to refresh or remove certain data
from the files.
